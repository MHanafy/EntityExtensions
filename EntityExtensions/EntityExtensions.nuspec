    <description>Entity Framework extenstions library (Bulk processing and Meta helpers)</description>
    <releaseNotes>This release brings the ability of reading database generated values (Identity and calculated columns) after performing the bulk update.
    BulkUpdate now supports a new parameter that controls what's read back from DB to allow finer control of performance.
    Along with that, comes code reorganization to extract vendor specific code to a separate Dll, in a step to pave the road for additional vendors without compelling users to reference unnecessary Dlls that they don't use.
    The code is fully backward compatible, So you code doesn't need to change after the upgrade.
